# LED driver board
## Overview
stm32 based board. Board will be used in electric bolid, adjusted for disabled people.

## Specifics
Application is desired to receive can frames with data and then, basing on data, to set proper LEDs.
Application is written In C using HAL library, for unit testin ceedling framework is used. Working enviroment is Atolic TrueStudio for STM32 v.9.3.0

Additionally, if you want to see live variables, you can  download [stmstudio](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm-studio-stm32.html). 

## Code organization

### Folders
* .metadata - eclpise files
* .settings - eclipse files
* Core - HAL hardware library, generated by MXCube
* Debug - debug data, .elf files are stored here.
* Drivers - CMSIS and board specific HAL drivers
* Startup - stm32 boot file
### Files
* led_driver.* - main program files
* .project - eclipse project configuration file
* STM32F103RC_FLASH.ld - stm32 linker script 
* LEDDriverBoard.ioc - MXCube project( for Hardware configuration) 

MXCUbe is hardware code generator, it always generate the main.* files so to leave it configurable, in MXCube, main.* files are not renamed in /Core directory. Only main() is moved to led_driver.c
